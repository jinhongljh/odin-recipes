    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large pork chops</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onions, halved and sliced</li>
        <li>8 large garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons capers, with liquid</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon dried oregano</li>

    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides and add to the hot skillet. Cook pork chops until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic to the hot skillet. Cook and stir until softened but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, capers and liquid, rosemary, red pepper flakes, oregano, and basil. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour any accumulated pork juices from the plate into the skillet and stir. Add cooked pork chops and cover with sauce. Simmer until warmed through, about 5 minutes.</li>
